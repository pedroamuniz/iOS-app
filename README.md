## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps
- Instagram
	- Easy to navigate between stories
    - Reels
- Telegram
    - Advanced Customization of the UI
    - Folders to group chats
- YouTube 
    - Shorts
    - Auto generated chapters for the videos
    
### Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app
I always thought of building an app where I can search for a specific product and it allows me to find the best price online. Let's say I'm looking for a new Mac computer, after searching for it, the application will show me a list of the best prices in the different stores. The main screen will show heavily discounted items based on my history. The app will allow me to add items to favorites so I don't miss out on a huge discount whenever possible.
